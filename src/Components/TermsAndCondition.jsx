              <p className="mb-4">
                These are the rules you agree to follow when you use the Akhuwat Foundation Loan website or services. Please do not use our platform if you do not agree to these rules.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                We can update or change these terms at any time without telling you first. People should come back to this page often to see any changes.
              </p>

              <h2 className="fw-bold mt-5 mb-4">1. What they mean</h2>
              <p>The banking services we offer through this platform are called "Akhuwat Foundation Loan."</p>
              <p>"Our" or "We" means the Akhuwat Foundation Loan team.</p>
              <p>The words "you" or "your" refer to anyone who uses our website or asks for a loan.</p>

              <h2 className="fw-bold mt-5 mb-4">2. Using a Website</h2>
              <p>
                When you use our site, you agree that you are at least 18 years old and legally able to make deals that are legally binding. You must not do anything bad, like spreading bugs, hacking, or changing the website's content.
              </p>

              <h2 className="fw-bold mt-5 mb-4">3. Services for loans</h2>
              <p>
                People who live in Pakistan and meet our requirements can get cash help from us. When filling out the application, you must give correct and honest information. It's not easy to get approval. Before final approval, the full loan terms will be shared, which will include when the payments are due and any fees that are involved. People who take money must pay it back on time.
              </p>

              <h2 className="fw-bold mt-5 mb-4">4. Who can apply What It Takes</h2>
              <ul className="fw-light mx-5">
                <li>Be a national or legal resident of Pakistan</li>
                <li>18 or older</li>
                <li>Maintain a current CNIC</li>
                <li>Have a cash source that can be checked</li>
                <li>Send in full and correct financial information</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Requests that aren't full or aren't eligible may be turned down.</p>

              <h2 className="fw-bold mt-5 mb-4">5. Obligations to pay back debts</h2>
              <p>
                Loans need to be paid back in stages, usually once a month. Paying late fees or hurting your credit score may happen if you don't. It is possible to pay off the loan early, which may lower the total cost.
              </p>

              <h2 className="fw-bold mt-5 mb-4">6. Paying fees and interest</h2>
              <p>
                We offer loans with low or no interest, based on the type and length of the loan. All fees, like application, handling, and late payment fees, will be made clear from the start.
              </p>

              <h2 className="fw-bold mt-5 mb-4">7. Security and privacy of information</h2>
              <p>
                We only need your personal information to process your loan, make sure you're eligible, and keep in touch. We won't sell or give your information to other people unless the law says we have to.
              </p>

              <h2 className="fw-bold mt-5 mb-4">8. External Websites</h2>
              <p>
                There may be links on this page to other websites. These outside websites have their own rules and material that we are not in charge of. Please read their rules on your own.
